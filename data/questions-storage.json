    "question": "Which of the following storage devices has no moving parts and is considered more durable for use in portable devices?",
    "options": [
      "Hard Disk Drive (HDD)",
      "Magnetic Tape",
      "Solid State Drive (SSD)",
      "Optical Disc"
    ],
    "answer": "Solid State Drive (SSD)",
    "explanation": "SSDs use flash memory with no moving parts, making them more shock-resistant and suitable for portable devices."

    "question": "Which type of storage access method does a hard disk drive use?",
    "options": [
      "Sequential access only",
      "Random access only",
      "Both sequential and random access",
      "Direct access only"
    ],
    "answer": "Random access only",
    "explanation": "HDDs support random (direct) access to any data block; magnetic tape is the medium that is primarily sequential."

    "question": "A company needs to store 100 video files, each 50 GB in size, without compression. How many 2 TB hard disks are required?",
    "options": [
      "2",
      "3",
      "4",
      "5"
    ],
    "answer": "3",
    "explanation": "Total size is 100 × 50 GB = 5000 GB (≈ 5 TB). Each 2 TB drive holds 2000 GB, so 3 drives provide 6000 GB, which is sufficient."

      "RAM",
      "Magnetic Tape",
      "Hard Disk Drive"
    ],
    "answer": "Magnetic Tape",
    "explanation": "Magnetic tape is sequential access and much slower to access arbitrary data than SSDs, HDDs, or RAM."

    "type": "mc",
    "question": "Why might an operating system be installed on an SSD rather than an HDD in a modern computer?",
    "options": [
      "SSDs have higher storage capacity for the same price.",
      "SSDs provide faster boot and program loading times.",
      "SSDs are easier to upgrade.",
      "SSDs are more compatible with older operating systems."
    ],
    "answer": "SSDs provide faster boot and program loading times.",
    "explanation": "The main advantage is speed: OS and applications start and respond more quickly from an SSD."

      "No need for an internet connection",
      "Access files from any device with internet",
      "Higher physical security"
    ],
    "answer": "Access files from any device with internet",
    "explanation": "Cloud storage allows remote access from multiple devices as long as an internet connection is available."

      "SSD",
      "HDD",
      "Magnetic Tape",
      "RAM"
    ],
    "answer": "Magnetic Tape",
    "explanation": "Magnetic tape offers low cost per GB and is suitable for long-term archival backups, though access is slow."
