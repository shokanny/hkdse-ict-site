    "type": "mc",
    "question": "Which of the following statements about RAM is correct?",
    "options": [
      "RAM is non-volatile and retains data when the computer is turned off.",
      "RAM is used to store the operating system permanently.",
      "Increasing RAM size can help a computer run more applications simultaneously.",
      "RAM has a slower access speed than a hard disk drive."
    ],
    "answer": "Increasing RAM size can help a computer run more applications simultaneously.",
    "explanation": "More RAM allows more programs and data to be kept in fast main memory, improving multitasking."

    "question": "Why is ROM used to store the BIOS and not RAM?",
    "options": [
      "ROM is faster than RAM.",
      "ROM can be easily modified by the user.",
      "ROM is non-volatile and retains data without power.",
      "ROM has a larger storage capacity than RAM."
    ],
    "answer": "ROM is non-volatile and retains data without power.",
    "explanation": "BIOS must remain stored even when the computer is switched off, so it is stored in non-volatile ROM."

  {
    "id": 8,
    "type": "mc",
    "question": "What is the main purpose of cache memory in a CPU?",
    "options": [
      "To store the operating system",
      "To keep frequently used data close to the CPU for quick access",
      "To provide backup power during outages",
      "To increase permanent storage capacity"
    ],
    "answer": "To keep frequently used data close to the CPU for quick access",
    "explanation": "Cache reduces access time by storing recently or frequently used instructions and data."
