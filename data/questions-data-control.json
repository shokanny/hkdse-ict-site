    "question": "What are the advantages of using a drop-down menu for entering dates in an online form instead of a text box? (1) Prevents invalid dates like February 30th (2) Ensures consistent date format (3) Allows users to type any date they want",
    "options": [
      "(1) and (2) only",
      "(1) and (3) only",
      "(2) and (3) only",
      "(1), (2) and (3)"
    ],
    "answer": "(1) and (2) only",
    "explanation": "Drop-down menus prevent invalid dates and ensure a consistent format, but they restrict users to predefined options rather than allowing any date."

    "question": "An 8-bit code 10110110 is received with the last bit as an even parity bit. Which of the following received codes has an error?",
    "options": [
      "11001100",
      "01100110",
      "10101011",
      "00110011"
    ],
    "answer": "10101011",
    "explanation": "10101011 has five 1's, which is an odd number and violates the requirement for even parity including the parity bit."

      "Data validation",
      "Data verification",
      "Data compression",
      "Data encryption"
    ],
    "answer": "Data verification",
    "explanation": "Entering the same data twice and comparing the entries is a form of data verification to reduce keying errors."

    "question": "A student ID number uses a check digit as the last digit. The validation method requires that the sum of all digits modulo 10 equals 0. Which of the following ID numbers is valid?",
    "options": [
      "56386",
      "56387",
      "56388",
      "56389"
    ],
    "answer": "56388",
    "explanation": "5 + 6 + 3 + 8 + 8 = 30, and 30 mod 10 = 0, so 56388 satisfies the check-digit rule."

      "Asking users to re-enter their username",
      "Sending a confirmation email to verify an account"
    ],
    "answer": "Checking that an age value falls between 0 and 150",
    "explanation": "Validation checks whether data is reasonable and within acceptable ranges; comparing two entries is verification."

    "question": "A computer receives three data sequences with even parity bits. Two sequences are corrupted: First: 0110 0110  Second: 1100 1011  Third: 1011 1100. Which sequences are corrupted?",
    "options": [
      "First and second",
      "First and third",
      "Second and third",
      "All three"

      "Receiving an SMS code to confirm the password change"
    ],
    "answer": "The password must contain at least one number and one special character",
    "explanation": "This is a validation rule that checks whether the data entered meets specific format or complexity requirements."

    "question": "Which of the following statements about check digits is correct?",
    "options": [
      "Check digits can correct all transmission errors automatically",
      "Check digits can detect some but not all types of errors",
      "Check digits ensure data is encrypted during transmission",
      "Check digits reduce the file size of transmitted data"
    ],
    "answer": "Check digits can detect some but not all types of errors",
    "explanation": "Check digits detect many common errors such as single-digit errors but cannot catch all possible error patterns."
