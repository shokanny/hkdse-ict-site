    "question": "A computer receives the data sequence 10110110 with the last bit as an odd parity bit. Which of the following statements is correct?",
    "options": [
      "The data is received correctly",
      "The data has a single-bit error",
      "The parity bit should be 0 for odd parity",
      "The sequence has even number of 1's including parity bit"
    ],
    "answer": "The data is received correctly",
    "explanation": "10110110 has five 1's, which is an odd number, satisfying the odd parity requirement."

    "answer": "27324",
    "explanation": "2 + 7 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 18, and 18 is divisible by 9, so 27324 is valid."

    "question": "An ISBN uses a specific check digit algorithm. What is the main limitation of check digit systems?",
    "options": [
      "They can correct errors automatically",
      "They can detect all types of transmission errors",
      "They cannot detect errors where multiple digits are transposed",
      "They increase data transmission speed"
