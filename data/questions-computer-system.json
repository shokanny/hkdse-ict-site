    "question": "A company is developing an AI-powered smartwatch that continuously monitors a user's heart rate and sends alerts in real-time if an anomaly is detected. Which of the following best describes the system's processing mode?",
    "options": [
      "Batch processing",
      "Distributed processing",
      "Real-time processing",
      "Offline processing"

    "question": "John is building a gaming PC and wants to ensure smooth gameplay in high-resolution VR environments. Which hardware upgrade would be least beneficial for this purpose?",
    "options": [
      "Upgrading from a dual-core to an octa-core CPU",
      "Increasing the size of the ROM",
      "Installing a GPU with higher VRAM",
      "Adding more RAM"
    ],
    "answer": "Increasing the size of the ROM",
    "explanation": "ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores firmware and is not frequently accessed, making it the least important for gaming performance."
