Answer Key for Computer System Questions
1. C – Real-time processing systems require immediate processing with no delay between input and output, which is critical for autopilot systems.
2. B – ROM (Read-Only Memory) stores firmware and is not frequently accessed by the user, making it the least important for multimedia performance compared to SSD, RAM, and CPU.
3. B – Faster data access speed (due to no moving parts).
4. C – The Program Counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction to be executed in the fetch cycle.
5. A – A system with multiple thin clients connected to a central server distributing tasks is a distributed processing system.
6. C – Compiling source code is the role of a compiler, not the operating system.
