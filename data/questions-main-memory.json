    "question": "Which of the following statements about RAM is correct?",
    "options": [
      "RAM is non-volatile and retains data when the computer is turned off.",
      "RAM is used to store the operating system permanently.",
      "Increasing RAM size can help a computer run more applications simultaneously.",
      "RAM has a slower access speed than a hard disk drive."
    ],
    "answer": "Increasing RAM size can help a computer run more applications simultaneously.",

    "question": "Why is ROM used to store the BIOS and not RAM?",
    "options": [
      "ROM is faster than RAM.",
      "ROM can be easily modified by the user.",
      "ROM is non-volatile and retains data without power.",
      "ROM has a larger storage capacity than RAM."
